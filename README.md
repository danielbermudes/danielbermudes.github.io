What is it?

- My project will be to create a vivid, interactive personal website to host all of my music, live performance videos and other related content.

Why this project?

- The reason why I want to head in this direction is because I no longer want to direct my audience and listeners to a social media platform like Instagram/Facebook, or a video platform like YouTube.
My philosophy behind this is that I want people to go on my website, and be directed to any platform they choose. I want everything ‘related’ to me to be all on one main hub.
Inspiration wise, I look at other artists/producers websites, and they all carry similar fundamentals, such as all their social media links, videos, announcements, even merchandise haha.

How does it work?

- It’ll be coded with HTML using JavaScript and CSS, using one of those templates as a starting point, and from there, viewers can access my biography, music, videos etc.
Its physical form will be hosted on the internet.
No hardware will be needed.
In terms of software, it’ll be edited in Atom.

What works?

- It physically looks appealing and carries all the essential information about me.
It is very easy to navigate, and is user friendly in that sense that a viewer doesn’t need to click their computer mouse to open new pages, it all can be viewed with a scroll motion!
Note: What I love about this specific template is that it’s very concise, and straight to the point. I tend to write too much at times, so this will definitely help me to get only the essential out.

What doesn’t work?

- The mailing list doesn’t work yet, but that’ll change soon:)

Final Comments

- I would love to (in the future haha) be able to create a feature where the main title page responds in a wavy motion based on the mouse movement the user does (got the idea from a producer named Madeon and his own website).
Also, I want to create a custom email template that everyone subscribed to my mailing list will receive, it’ll look vibrant!
